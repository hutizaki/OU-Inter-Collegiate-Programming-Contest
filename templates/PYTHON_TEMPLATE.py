"""
STRUCTURE FOR AI AGENTS:
- Keep the header block below (URL, Group Members, Time to completion).
- Put problem notes / scratch work in comment blocks above main().
- When adding or modifying code, wrap AI-added sections with:
    # ### AI ###
    ... code or comment ...
    # ### AI ###
  so it's easy to find and review later.
